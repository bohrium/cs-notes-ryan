    Ryan, these $21$ questions are for practice.  A 45 minute technical
    interview might have three such questions.  Questions marked with \real are
    (inspired by) actual ones I've gotten.  Questions marked with \hard are
    especially challenging; I wouldn't expect more than one in an interview.
    Each question has a main version as well as a followup twist that an
    interviewer might ask upon satisfactory solution of the main version.  It
    might be good to avoid reading these yourself, instead asking Chloe to draw
    randomly from these questions during a practice interview.

    Questions of the form \emph{determine xyz given abc} stand for
    \emph{construct a program that determines xyz given abc}.  Also implicit is
    the expectation that you explain what assumptions you make and that you
    offer an informal complexity analysis for each solution.  For example, you
    may want to remark on your assumptions about the types and probability
    distribution of input data and on which parameters you regard as
    asymptotically large.

    \quest{popularity contest}{%
        from a non-empty list of names identify the name(s) of greatest
        frequency.
    }{%
        identify the $10^4$ most frequently occuring names (assumed
        unique) from a list of length $10^6$.

    \quest{\real legal parentheses}{%
        check whether a given string of \cd{(}s and \cd{)}s is well-formed.%

        what if we permit both round and square brackets?
        we regard \cd{([)]} as ill-formed.%
    }
    \quest{justify text}{%
        a paragraph is a list $(x_i: 0\leq i<N)$ of words with natural widths
        $w_i$.  we segment a paragraph into lines and slightly stretch each
        word.  precisely, we choose indices $(i_j: 0\leq j<J)$ of the first
        word in each $j$th line as well as a stretch amount $(\rho_i \in
        [-0.1, +0.1]: 0\leq i<N)$ for each word.
        %
        we then render the $i$th word at width $(1+\rho_i) w_i$ so that each
        line fits, i.e., so that the excess $e_j = W - \sum_{l_j \leq i <
        l_{j+1}} (1+\rho_i) w_i$ is non-negative.  determine $\rho_i$, $J$,
        and $l_j$ that minimize the \emph{distortion} $D = \sum_j e_j^3 +
        \lambda \sum_i \rho_i^2$.

        in a greedy approach, we set $l_1$ and $(\rho_i:l_0\leq i<l_1)$ to
        minimize the distortion $e_0^3 + \lambda \sum_{l_0\leq i<l_1} \rho_i^2$

    \quest{viola jones}{%

    \quest{\hard memory allocation}{%
        implement a simple memory allocator (i.e., implement \cd{char*

        primitive \cd{char* sbrk(int nb\_kilobytes)} to request chunks of
        memory from the OS.  (\cd{sbrk} stands for \emph{space increments after program break address}.)%

        our video game makes a large number of small ($\leq 8$ byte)
        allocations (representing polygons etc) when rendering each frame, and

        a farmer tries to herd musical cows all onto some single hill
        in a finite set $H$ of hills.  each cow starts on some hill in $H$.

        happens, all the cows on hill $h$ move to the hill $f(s,h)$.  given

        some sequence of songs.%

        relation of least size.%

    \quest{\hard bipartite graph}{%
        the theory of markov chains references \emph{$k$-periodic graphs}.

        king, and no other pieces.  the knights start as close as possible to
        one corner; the king, to the opposite corner.  this game has no rules
        about draws --- no stalemate, no draw by repetition, no draw upon 50
        reversible moves.  \emph{can black force a checkmate?}%

        a new hall is to be built among a square grid of streets.  we label street

        $p(x,y)$ many residents.  place the hall at an intersection so as to

    \quest{\hard task scheduling}{%
        we employ three oxen on our farm: jesse, pat, and sandy.  each $t$
        in a list $T$ of $1000$ tasks requires the simultaneous effort of $n_t$
        many oxen over a contiguous period of $d_t$ many days.  a schedule

        whether a key is present and its value is so; and that permits
        insertion of new key-value pair, with the least-recently
        inserted-or-queried pair removed if space is needed.%
