    Ryan, these questions are for practice.  A 45 minute technical interview
    might have two or three such questions.  Questions marked with \real are
    (inspired by) actual ones I've gotten.  Each question has a main version as
    well as a followup twist that an interviewer might ask upon satisfactory
    solution of the main version.  It might be good to avoid reading these
    yourself, instead asking Chloe to draw randomly from these questions during
    a practice interview.

    Questions of the form \emph{determine xyz given abc} stand for
    \emph{construct a program that determines xyz given abc}.  Also implicit is
    the expectation that you explain what assumptions you make and that you
    offer an informal complexity analysis for each solution.  For example, you
    may want to remark on your assumptions about the types and probability
    distribution of input data and on which parameters you regard as
    asymptotically large.

    %Tools to have in your toolbox include 
    %\textbf{DFS-stacks},
    %\textbf{BFS-queues},
    %\textbf{dynamic programming},

    \quest{legal parentheses}{%

    \quest{missing numbers}{%
        given a length-$(n-1)$ array $L$ containing distinct integers in the
        range $R = [0,n)$, determine the element of $R$ not in $L$.% 
    }{%
        now $L$ has length $n-2$ and misses two elements of $R$.  determine

        totally ordered.  determine whether a list of elements of this type
        has all elements distinct.

        does your solution use as few comparisons as possible (asymptotically)?

    \quest{herding cows}{%
        \real a farmer tries to herd musical cows all onto some single hill
        in a finite set $H$ of hills.  each cow starts on some hill in $H$.
        the farmer may blare any $s$ in a finite set $S$ of songs; when this
        happens, all the cows on hill $h$ move to the hill $f(s,h)$.  given
        $H,S,f$ determine whether the farmer may achieve her goal by blaring
        some sequence of songs.%

        of cows?%

    \quest{sparse vectors}{%
        \real a sparse vector is a list of numbers most of which are zero.

              product.

              large sparse matrices.

    \quest{lru cache}{%
        \real write an lru cache that maps small strings (say, urls) to large
        strings (say, html).  that is, implement a data structure that at any
        time stores $\leq k$ many key-value pairs; that permits querying for
        whether a key is present and its value is so; and that permits
        insertion of new key-value pair, with the least-recently
        inserted-or-queried pair removed if space is needed.%

        relation of least size.%

    \quest{bipartite graph}{%
        the theory of markov chains references \emph{$k$-periodic graphs}. 
        an undirected graph is $k$-periodic if $k$ divides

        $2$-periodic.%

        type.  we display ancestor trees in this style:

    }{%
        compute two people's genetic relation given their ancestor trees.
        the genetic relation of siblings is $1/2$; of cousins is

        name people, and we assume people have distinct and unique names.%

        king, and no other pieces.  the knights start as close as possible to
        one corner; the king, to the opposite corner.  this game has no rules
        about draws --- no stalemate, no draw by repetition, no draw upon 50
        reversible moves.  \emph{can black force a checkmate?}%

        a csv file is a text file representing a 2D grid of entries, with rows
        delimited by newlines and with elements of a row delimited by commas.

        a new hall is to be built for a city enjoying a square grid of streets.
        we label the intersections by $(x,y)$ for $0\leq x,y<100$.  it takes
        $|x-x^\prime|+|y-y^\prime|$ minutes to walk between intersections at
        $(x,y)$ and $(x^\prime, y^\prime)$.  at intersection $(x,y)$ live
        $p(x,y)$ residents.  we wish to place the city hall at an intersection
        so as to minimize the walking time from residence to hall, averaged
        uniformly over residents.  compute an ideal placement given $p$.

        a rectangular park has northwest corners $(a,b)$ and southeast corner

    \quest{task scheduling}{%
        we employ three oxen on our farm: jesse, pat, and sandy.  each task $t$
        in a list $T$ of $1000$ tasks requires the simultaneous effort of $n_t$
        many oxen over a contiguous period of $d_t$ many days.  a schedule
        assigns each ox-day to some task.  determine a schedule that completes
        all tasks in $T$ by year's end, if possible.%
